**Type:** Landmark / Public Institution

## Overview
Brookside District School, usually just called "Brookside," serves every grade in town from kindergarten through senior year. Three squat brick buildings cluster around a shared courtyard and a dusty baseball diamond, keeping roughly 300 students on a single campus.

## Atmosphere
- **Lighting / Weather:** Fluorescent hallways, sunlit classrooms, and a persistent draft at the main entrance.
- **Sound / Mood:** Locker doors slamming, sneakers squeaking in the gym, and the distant crack of a bat at practice.
- **Textures / Architecture:** Faded brick, narrow windows, and trophy cases that smell faintly of varnish and old paper.

## Notable Locations Within
### The Courtyard
A cracked concrete square with a few benches and a flagpole. Students gather here between classes and after lunch.

### The Baseball Diamond
A well-worn field behind the buildings, used for practice, pickup games, and late-night dares.

## Key NPCs
- **Principal Hayes:** Strict but fair, determined to keep the school running on schedule.
- **Coach Leon Burke:** The baseball coach and gym teacher who knows every family in town.

## Time Loop Notes
TBD
