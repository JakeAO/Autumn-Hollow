**Type:** Business / Social Hub

## Overview
The Daybreak Grill is Autumn Hollow's only real restaurant, a cozy diner with deep booths and a long counter of swivel stools. Locals come here for steady coffee, comfort food, and to hear what Old Marlene thinks about whatever just happened in town.

## Atmosphere
- **Lighting / Weather:** Warm amber lights over the booths and counter; fogged windows on cold mornings.
- **Sound / Mood:** The sizzle of the griddle, the clink of plates, and the low hum of conversation.
- **Textures / Architecture:** Vinyl booths with slight cracks, a polished counter, and a tile floor worn smooth by decades of boots.

## Notable Locations Within
### The Counter
The best spot to watch Old Marlene cook. Regulars treat the counter like a front-row seat to the town's unofficial news desk.

### The Back Booth
A tucked-away booth where teens and night-shift workers hold hushed conversations after closing time.

## Key NPCs
- **Old Marlene:** Head cook and de facto boss of the diner. She does not own the place, but everyone listens when she speaks.

## Time Loop Notes
TBD
