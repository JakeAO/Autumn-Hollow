# Brookside Cineplex

**Type:** Business / Social Hub

## Overview
The Brookside Cineplex is the primary entertainment venue in Autumn Hollow. With only two screens, it usually hosts at least one major blockbuster and one cult classic or family film. It’s the go-to spot for first dates and Friday nights for the high school crowd.

## Atmosphere
- **Lighting / Weather:** A glowing neon marquee that buzzes softly in the cool October air; dim, red-carpeted hallways inside.
- **Sound / Mood:** The constant, comforting pop-pop-pop of the popcorn machine; muffled audio from the theaters leaking into the lobby.
- **Textures / Architecture:** Slightly sticky floors; heavy velvet curtains; walls lined with hand-painted movie posters.

## Notable Locations Within
### The Concession Stand
Serving fresh popcorn, classic candy boxes, and fountain soda in oversized paper cups. The staff is usually local high schoolers who might let their friends in for free if the manager isn't looking.

### Theater 1
The larger of the two screens, equipped with slightly worn rocking chairs and a screen that has a faint, permanent smudge in the lower left corner.

## Key NPCs
- **Mr. Henderson:** The grumpy manager who takes the "No Outside Food" rule way too seriously.
- **Becky S.:** A high school junior usually working the ticket booth, often seen reading a paperback horror novel between customers.

## Time Loop Notes
TBD
