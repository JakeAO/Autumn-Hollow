summary: "The town's small hardware store run by Andy Danbury."
---

**Type:** Business

## Overview
Danbury’s Hardware is a staple of Autumn Hollow, a cramped but well-organized shop that smells of sawdust, floor wax, and oil. It’s where everyone goes for tools, salt for the winter, and local gossip.

## Atmosphere
- **Lighting / Weather:** Dimly lit by flickering fluorescent tubes; the front window is often fogged up on cold October mornings.
- **Sound / Mood:** The melodic chime of a bell above the door; the low hum of an old refrigerator in the back.
- **Textures / Architecture:** Creaky wooden floorboards that have been polished for decades; high shelves packed to the ceiling with metal bins and cardboard boxes.

## Notable Locations Within
### The Tool Aisle
A narrow corridor of wrenches, hammers, and saws. It’s rumored that some of the heavy-duty equipment hasn’t been touched since the 70s.

### The Back Workshop
Andy’s private space for sharpening blades and fixing small appliances. The smell of grease is strongest here.

## Key NPCs
- **Andy Danbury:** The owner. A man of few words but deep knowledge of the town’s pipes and foundations. He’s always wearing a canvas apron.

## Time Loop Notes
TBD
