**Type:** Business / Social Hub

## Overview
Shakey's Arcade is the town's aging game hall, where teens, regulars, and a few nostalgic adults gather after school. The cabinets are old and temperamental, but Mr. Shakey keeps them running with careful repairs and scavenged parts.

## Atmosphere
- **Lighting / Weather:** Missing fluorescent tubes leave uneven pools of light; the front sign flickers on cold evenings.
- **Sound / Mood:** A constant mix of 8-bit music, coin drops, and the clack of joysticks; a mellow, familiar buzz.
- **Textures / Architecture:** Worn carpet patterned with neon swirls; cabinets with chipped corners and hand-written repair notes.

## Notable Locations Within
### The Back Row
The oldest cabinets live here, including a few machines with custom wiring and taped-on instructions. Regulars whisper that one game has never been beaten.

### The Prize Counter
A short glass case with dusty plastic toys and a perpetually half-empty bin of tickets. Mr. Shakey will sometimes trade extra tickets for help cleaning up.

## Key NPCs
- **Mr. Shakey:** The owner, an elderly man with no known family in town. He does not socialize much outside the arcade but always greets the regulars by name.

## Time Loop Notes
TBD
