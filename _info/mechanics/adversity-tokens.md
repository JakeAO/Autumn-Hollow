# Adversity Tokens & Consequences

## Adversity Tokens

Adversity Tokens represent mounting stress, fear, injuries, and complications.

### Gaining Adversity Tokens
You gain tokens when:
- **Failed important rolls** – Things go wrong
- **Flaws are triggered** – Your weaknesses cause problems
- **Fears are triggered** – You face what terrifies you
- **GM compels** – Story demands complications
- **Dangerous situations** – Taking risks that don't pay off

### Using Adversity Tokens
**Players can spend tokens for:**
- **+1 to any roll** per token spent (spend before or after rolling)
- Describe how desperation, adrenaline, or determination helps you succeed

### GM Using Adversity Tokens
The GM can trigger your accumulated tokens to:
- Create narrative complications
- Have something go wrong at the worst time
- Introduce new obstacles or dangers
- Make situations more dire

## Managing Tokens

### Token Economy
- Start each session with 0 tokens (unless carrying over from cliffhanger)
- Build up tokens through failures and complications
- Spend strategically on critical moments
- High token counts mean you're in deep trouble

### Clearing Tokens
Tokens typically clear when:
- Scene ends and characters catch their breath
- Significant downtime or rest
- Major story milestone is achieved
- Danger is resolved (GM discretion)

## Lasting Consequences

### Injuries & Conditions
When harm is severe, you might gain lasting conditions:
- **Minor:** "Sprained Ankle," "Shaken," "Scratched Up"
- **Major:** "Broken Arm," "Traumatized," "Haunted by Visions"
- These act like temporary Flaws until healed

### Recovering from Consequences
- **Minor conditions:** Heal after rest or medical attention
- **Major conditions:** Require significant time or special treatment
- **Psychological trauma:** May need therapy, support, or confronting fears

## Death & Serious Harm

- Characters can be incapacitated, captured, or traumatized
- The horror escalates but kids survive (usually)
- Major consequences shape character development
