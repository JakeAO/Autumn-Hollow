Kids On Bikes is a collaborative storytelling RPG where you play young characters solving mysteries in your small town.

## Core Mechanics

### Using Dice
Different dice represent different stats:
- **d4** – Weakest stat
- **d6** – Below average stat
- **d8** – Average stat
- **d10** – Above average stat
- **d12** – Best stat
- **d20** – Expert stat (very rare)

### Making Checks
When attempting something risky or uncertain:
1. GM sets a **target number** (usually 7-15)
2. Roll your relevant stat die
3. Compare result to target:
   - **Meet or exceed:** Success!
   - **Below target:** Failure or complication

### Adversity Tokens
When things go wrong, you gain Adversity Tokens:
- **Spend 1 token:** Add +1 to any roll
- **GM can trigger tokens:** Create complications for narrative effect
- Tokens represent stress, fear, and mounting danger

## The Four Actions

### Investigate
Use your brain to search for clues, solve puzzles, or figure things out.
- Roll **Brains** to research, deduce, or analyze

### Persuade
Talk to people, negotiate, or manipulate social situations.
- Roll **Charm** to befriend, deceive, or smooth talk

### Move
Physical actions like running, climbing, sneaking, or dodging.
- Roll **Fight** or **Flight** depending on approach

### Overcome
Deal with obstacles, whether physical, mental, or supernatural.
- Roll appropriate stat based on the challenge

## Collaborative Storytelling
- **Everyone contributes:** Players can describe results, add details, and suggest ideas
- **GM guides:** The GM sets scenes, plays NPCs, and adjudicates rules
- **Failure is interesting:** Failed rolls don't stop the story—they complicate it
